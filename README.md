Well hopefully your account isn't empty, but just where did all that money go?

Like Elon Musk, you must have burned up all your money like rocket fuel from the Heavy Falcon. (Hence the name Money Rocket)

 ## Introducing Money Rocket aka 💰 🚀

 This application helps provide a visualization of exactly where you are spending all your hard earned cash 💰.

 Using the Money Rocket App is easy as pie.

 1. Create Account (or Login if you somehow magically already have an account)
 2. You will be directed to the dashboard
 3. Add your expenses (everytime you buy something add your expense) using the button at top or pink one on the bottom right corner
 * Be sure to add the price, mark category, and leave a brief comment about your expense.
 4. See the magic happen as the Money Rocket creates a visually stunning pie chart showing your expenses.

 ## How it all works ⚙️

 The Money Rocket Application is using some of today's (Feb. 8, 2018) latest technology. 

 * Materialize Framework
 * Sequelize
 * D3.js (this helps display those fancy charts)
 * Express
 * Handlebars
 * Passport
 * Bcrypt

 With Passport.js and Bcrypt, your password is secure! 
 (Thanks Nathan Chen for helping provide security for our users)

## Want to run your own version of Money Rocket 💰 🚀?

Well luckily this project is open source and was purely made for fun.

To deploy this app, please follow these simple steps:
* Clone Repo to your local
* For your local, activate MySQL and MAMP (recommended: 8889, but you can change that)
* Command: npm install
* Command: node server.js (or nodemon)

To deploy on Heroku, well that's always a fun challenge.
